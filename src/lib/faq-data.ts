    question: "What is the difference between EN31 and AISI 52100 steel balls?",
    answer: `EN31 and AISI 52100 are essentially equivalent grades of high-carbon chromium bearing steel. Both offer:
    • High hardness (60-67 HRC after heat treatment)
    • Excellent wear resistance and dimensional stability
    • Superior fatigue strength for bearing applications
    • Chemical composition: ~1% Carbon, ~1.5% Chromium
    EN31 is the British standard while AISI 52100 is the American designation for the same material specification.`
